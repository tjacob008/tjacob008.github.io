## Education	 			        		
- B.S.E., Electrical Engineering | University of Pennsylvania (_May 2028_)

## Experience
**Independent Biomedical Engineering Researcher (_Oct 2022 - June 2024_)**
- Constructed an Arduino-based intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement setup and wrote an algorithm to measure the pressure of a biomechanical eye model.
- Designed, built, and tested finger-tip sensor for IOP measurement, a novel finger-tip pressure sensor, _TonoSense_ ($18) for early detection of Glaucoma.

**Astronomy Research Fellow @ Yale University (_June 2023 - Aug 2023_)**
- Captured images and conducted photometry of Type Ia Supernova 2023kuy using Leitner Observatory's 16" RCOS telescope.
- Performed photometric and spectroscopic analysis, extracting the light curve to identify a distant supernova.

## Projects
### _DropWise_: Automatic Water Dispensing System

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### _TonoSense_: A Novel Device for Glaucoma Screening

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
